## Visual Molecular Dynamics
[VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) is a useful program that lets us 
view what's going on in our molecular dynamics trajectories in a fairly 
straightforward way. What is less straightforward is how to use the program to 
make nice pictures to represent our simulations, so here I wanted to just write 
a quick guide on how I do this, hopefully in a way that should be easy to 
understand so if you personally dislike one of my settings you can change it 
without needing to change the rest of the guide.

# Launching VMD
There's actually a number of methods to start a simulation in VMD. I tend to use
the following command:

    vmd -parm7 topology.top -netcdf trajectory.nc

Which immediately opens and loads the trajectory file as opposed to going
through the standard menus. Through this guide I'm going to use PDB
[1P78](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1P78)[1], which is a structure near and dear
to my heart.
  
# Representations

Once your trajectory or PDB has loaded, by default it will appear as a lines
representation. My quick settings to change generally are:

Display > Depth Cueing off\\
		> Axes Off

Graphics > Colors > Display > Background > 8 White




# The render commands

Once you have tkconsole open, you need to use the render command. This will be
slightly different based on how you have VMD installed, I've included two
different examples from my usage here. On my laptop I use:

    render Tachyon scene.dat "/home/elliot/VMD/vmd-1.9.3/lib/tachyon/tachyon_LINUXAMD64 -aasamples 12 %s -format TGA -res 3840 2160 -o %s.tga"

On my workstation at the University of York, I use:

    render Tachyon scene.dat "/opt/york/phys/net/Modules/VMD/1.9.3/1/default/build/tachyon_LINUXAMD64 -aasamples 12 %s -format TGA -res 3840 2160 -o %s.tga"
