## Visual Molecular Dynamics
VMD is a useful program that lets us view what's going on in our molecular
dynamics trajectories in a fairly straightforward way. What is less
straightforward is how to use the program to make nice pictures to represent our
simulations, so here I wanted to just write a quick guide on how I do this,
hopefully in a way that should be easy to understand so if you personally
dislike one of my settings you can change it without needing to change the rest
of the guide.
