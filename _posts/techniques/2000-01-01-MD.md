## What is Molecular Dynamics?
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational approach for studying the motion of a
over time. At a base level, it can be explained in just a few steps:

1. Obtain initial atomic coordinates 
2. Randomly assign a velocity to each atom such that total kinetic energy agrees with the desired temperature
3. Calculate the force on each atom
4. Use Newton's second law to calculate each atom's acceleration 
5. Calculate velocities for the next timestep
6. Repeat from step 3 until desired simulation time has run
