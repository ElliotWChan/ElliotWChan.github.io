# What is "What is..." 
I like to think I'm not entirely useless with some science at this point, so I
figured what the world needs is yet another site that explains the basics behind
scientific techniques and theories. Okay I didn't really think that, I just
enjoy writing about science, and procrastinating my thesis. 

# What is molecular dynamics 
What better way to start than with the main technique I use in my own research? 
This is a computational method called ["molecular
dynamics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics). This is
effectively a way to simulate the movement of atoms over short time steps. Using
this method, I can track the interactions between proteins and short sequences
of DNA. 

The basics of the technique is as follows:
<ol>
<li> Create an initial structure</li>
<li> Calculate the forces between every single pair of atoms in your system</li>
<li> Apply this force on all atoms and advance in time </li>
<li> Repeat as long as necessary</li>
</ol>
